## Supervised learning 

Supervised learning is a machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. 

The algorithms include:
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression 
- Neural networks 
- Decision tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random forest
- Naive Bayes
- K-nearest neighbor
